# Documentation
Whenever making updates in this app be in the mindset that a different LLM or developer may need to come and make updates to this app later. So always document your work in the appropriate files in the .builder/rules files. To create/update a rules file for Builder's AI:

Create a .mdc file within the .builder/rules/ directory or update an existing one as appropriate. Provide a sensible name for your file and provide the metadata as shown below.

# example of a .builder/rules/ file
# .builder/rules/component-structure.mdc

<add whatever documentation is needed>

The following options are available as keys within the metadata header:

description: a brief description of the file's rules
globs: specific file paths where these rules should apply
alwaysApply: if set to true, the AI always applies these rules; otherwise, the AI contextually decides when to apply the rules
** You should use alwaysApply:false unless it's a rule that should be sent to the LLM no matter what you are working on. Very few files should be always apply.
